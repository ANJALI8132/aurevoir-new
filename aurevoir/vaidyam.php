                            <p>Vaidyam is a specialty Ayurvedic wellness and rejuvenation center headed by a qualified and highly-respected Vaidyan or physician.

                            <p>Ayurveda is a proven traditional treatment methodology to increase one's immunity against viruses such as COVID-19 as well as to rejuvenate your body, mind and soul post COVID-19. Ayurveda emphasizes prevention of disease, rejuvenation of the body's immune system, and longevity of life.</p>

                            <p>The insightful assertion and promise of Ayurveda is that through right practices handed down over centuries, not only can we thwart illnesses but we can also better understand ourselves and the world around us while living long healthy lives in balance and harmony and achieve our fullest potential expressing our true inner-self on a daily basis.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda views each and every person as unequaled, with a unique mind-body constitution and a singular set of life circumstances, all of which must be considered in determining the healing approaches and recommendations for everyday life. This is similar to the view of modern science where the structure of the DNA makes every human being unique and an entity unto him or herself. At Vaidyam we treat each patient based on his/her specific need.</p>
