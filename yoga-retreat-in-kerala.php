It is a mental, spiritual and physical order and it is essentially a way of life that lets you be in perfect harmony with yourself and your environment. Yoga encompasses the entire body, mind, and spirit and this helps in personal development. Your own consciousness unites with the universal consciousness through Yoga.</p>
                            <p>Kerala is well-known for its Ayurvedic treatments and world-class Yoga sessions. Yoga retreats in Kerala are famous for their treatments and medication.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits of Yoga</h3>
                            <p>Yoga ameliorates strength, balance, and flexibility. It helps improve breathing. Yoga provides relief from chronic back pain and is beneficial for heart health. You get a better sleep by practicing Yoga. Yoga boosts your mental and physical energy. It is great for stress management and reduces anxiety. Yoga reduces inflammation. It promotes better self-care.</p>
                            <p>Here are the things you must know before heading to a Yoga Retreat:</p>

                            <h3>Research the Instructor</h3>
                            <p>If you are going to a Yoga Retreat for the first time, or after some time, you should ensure your Yoga teacher matches your personality and know the kinds of styles that they are masters of. If this research is not conducted properly, you would probably ruin a supposedly effective retreat.</p>

                            <h3>The kind of Yoga you will be practicing</h3>
                            <p>You should be knowing what kind of Yoga you will be doing throughout your stay, even though you might be an adventurous person and have a love for trying out new things. If your mind knows what to expect, then your level of preparedness will increase for any type of Yoga.</p>

                            <h3>Timetable of activities</h3>
                            <p>You should enquire about the timetable of activities planned out through the retreat. It should not happen that you spend most of the time doing Yoga and do not have time for leisure activities.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Downtime planning</h3>
                            <p>There should be room for activities like reading, taking a nap or taking a walk which are highly essential for your personal downtime. Your downtime needs to be thoroughly planned out so that you can enjoy maximum and this has to be chalked out personally.</p>

                            <h3>Keep it Solo</h3>
                            <p>A solo mission is best for a Yoga Retreat. When you go alone, you are stepping out of your comfort zone to achieve something that is refreshing and rejuvenating for your body, mind, and soul. You get the opportunity to meet new interesting people and can make friends and expand your network.</p>

                            <h3>Know your Budget </h3>
                            <p>Financial planning is crucial for your Yoga Retreat, to get the ultimate experience. The cheapest Retreat may not always provide that. You will have to save up to gain the most special and meaningful experience.</p>

                            <h3>The right mindset</h3>
                            <p>Do not carry business email, office tasks or students assignments to the Yoga Retreat. You have to keep all kinds of distractions minimal. Stay open minded. </p>
