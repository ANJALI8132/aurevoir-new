                            <p>Ayurveda - science of life, is a healing system practiced over 5000 years ago in India, with a holistic approach to health and personalised medicine. Being one of the oldest systems existing on earth, it comprises thousands of medical concepts and hypotheses.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda has its roots in ancient India and the central theoretical ideas of Ayurveda were developed in Sanskrit. 'Ayus' means life and 'Veda' means knowledge. The knowledge contained in Ayurveda deals with nature, elements and purpose of life, and includes it's metaphysical and physical aspects - health and ailment, happiness and anguish, pain and pleasure. Ayurveda defines life as the convergence of body, mind and spirit planted in and embracing all creation. Ayurveda states that the purpose of life is to know or realise the creator, both within and without, and to express this divinity in one's day-to-day life.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Personalised lifestyle management:</h3>

                            <h3>Ayurveda - Endowment of nature</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda believes that the entire universe is composed of five fundamentals: Vayu (Air), Jala (Water), Aakash (Space or Cosmos), Prithvi (Earth) and Teja (Fire). India has a rich history of a traditional system of medicine based upon six systems, out of which Ayurveda stands to be the most ancient, most extensively accepted, rehearsed and flourished indigenous system of medicine. The other confederated systems of medicine in India are Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, Yoga and Naturopathy. Ayurveda is the most dominant system amongst the other Indian systems of medicine and finds its frequency universally since centuries. The lifestyle-based prescriptions and diet of Ayurveda are aimed at getting you back in touch with your true nature, so that making lasting, healthy changes becomes less of a battle. They’re designed to balance three energies that exist within all of us: vata (space and air), pitta (fire and water), and kapha (water and earth).</p>

                            <h3>Medical tourism:</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda has been a way of life in India for thousands of years, yet only recently has it attracted the attention of the West. But why we still have not really explored the science of our own Ayurveda. A new form of tourism - medical tourism, is a trend in which patients in the advanced world are looking overseas for medical treatment. India, especially Kerala, serves to be the best place that offers the finest ayurvedic treatment packages with a high quality. Ayurveda treatment packages in Kerala with a rich heritage are attracting the visitors to our country for a health retreat, thus promoting tourism also. Global acceptance of Ayurvedic healing has definitely widened up the bounds and perspectives of Ayurveda tourism.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic medicines were documented in the sacred historical texts known as the Vedas, numerous centuries ago. Though Ayurveda has a heritage of thousands of years, it is now integrated with other traditional practices, including yoga to enhance its benefits. The stressed population of the ultramodern world is turning towards naturopathic mending of Ayurveda for soothing relief and comfort. It has the ability to treat many chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma, which are untreatable in modern medicine. But, lack of scientific validation in various concepts lead to this precious gift from our ancestors trailing.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda is geared in the direction of preventing diseases, not just eradicating its symptoms. In contrast to Western medicine, it treats an individual, not an ailment alone. An ayurvedic health practitioner, is a primary care doctor, counselor, and personal trainer whose aim is to make you as healthy as you can be. In addition, Ayurveda tourism facilitates concerned patients to get them familiar with some of the specialized practitioners related to this field.</p>


                            <h3> Maintaining balanced 'prakriti':</h3>
                            <p>Every individual has a specific pattern of energy - an inborn constitution (prakriti) that shapes our bodies, minds, and predilections. This constitution is determined by perception of a number of factors and remains the same throughout one’s life. Any factors - internal and external, may act upon us to disturb this balance, thus turning us into an imbalanced state. It can be due to emotional and physical stresses including one’s emotional state, diet and food choices, seasons and weather, physical trauma, work and family associations. Once we identify these factors, we can opt befitting conduct to avoid or minimize their effects or rule out the causes of imbalance and re-establish one’s original constitution.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda emphasises on the preservation of health through close attention to balance in one’s life, right thinking, diet, lifestyle and the use of natural herbs. Knowledge of Ayurveda enables one to understand how to bring on this balance of body, mind and awareness according to one’s own individual constitution and how to make lifestyle changes for this. Ayurveda, the globally recognised ancient healing practice is thriving, as locals and tourists head for the health retreat in Kerala.</p>
