                            <p>"True beauty comes from within". </p>
                            <p>This is the beauty mantra that Ayurveda, the oldest traditional healing science emphasises on. According to Ayurveda, beauty is an intimate part of the human personality. The holistic discipline of Ayurveda is related to every aspect of body, mind and the soul.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic beauty treatment in Kerala involves the overall wellbeing of the body including skin care, hair growth, and skin ailments. The treatment also includes purification of the body, providing optimum nutrition to the body, and the balancing of the three doshas.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Ayurvedic Skin Care</h3>
                            <p>The practice of Ayurvedic skin care includes Ayurvedic facials, treatments for skin diseases, and herbal formulations for the skin. Ayurvedic home remedies are also targeted to some specific skin types.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Understanding Skin Types</h3>
                            <p>Skin types form the basis for Ayurvedic skin care treatments.</p>
                            <p>As per Ayurveda, your skin type is based on three doshas - vata (wind), pitta (fire), and kapha (water and earth).</p>
                            <p>If vata dominates you, yours will be dry and rough skin that will wrinkle if not moisturized regularly. You must use oil-based moisturizers.</p>
                            <p>If your pitta dosha is high, you tend to have oily skin that's prone to acne. This skin type needs cooling elements like aloe vera, turmeric, and sandalwood.</p>
                            <p>Kapha skin is cold and oily, prone to pimples, whiteheads, and water retention. If you have this skin type, you need to apply face masks regularly.</p>
                            <p>Sesame oil is recommended for all doshas, and almond oil for vata and pitta skin types. Oil should be massaged into the skin in a circular motion.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurvedic Skin Care Routine</h3>
                            <p>Ayurvedic skin care routine is based on balancing the whole body and supporting the digestive system with a healthy diet while treating each individual according to the specific dosha. Use organic and natural skin care products that have minimum side effects and no chemicals. Consistent use gives better results. Patience is essential for  a great skin.</p>

                            <p>Skin care routine has three basic steps:</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Cleansing</h4>  
                            <p>It is the process of removing impurities from the skin. It is done twice or thrice a day to remove the environmental pollutants and dirt clogged in the pores, using natural cleansers that remove impurities without affecting the natural oils present in the skin.Aloe vera, Neem, Tulsi, Sandalwood are good cleansing agents.</p>  
                            
                            <h4 class="color-g">Toning</h4>
                            <p>Toner cleans the oil from the skin.The skin is freshened. Blood supply is increased to the skin. Any residual cleanser is removed. Natural pH level of the skin is restored leaving your skin clean, clear and ready to be hydrated.</p>
                            <p>Rose, Lavender, Vetiver and Jasmine oils can be used as toners.</p>

                            <h4 class="color-g">Moisturizing</h4>
                            <p>Moisturizing is the process of hydrating and nourishing the skin. The skin loses its natural moisture as a result of exposure to the environment, regular cleansing, and due to ageing. Use natural ingredients like coconut milk, sesame oil, essential oils for the purpose of moisturizing.</p>
                            <p>Your skin care journey will be fruitful if you combine the regimen of cleansing, toning, and moisturizing with regular exfoliation.</p>
                            <p>Exfoliation is the removal of dead cells from the skin's surface. Ayurvedic scrubs like ubtan (oatmeal and chickpea flour), used for exfoliation are 100% natural. How often you need exfoliation depends on the skin type and face scrub chosen.</p>

                            <h3>Protection against the sun</h3>
                            <p>A broad-spectrum sunscreen is required to block the UVA and UVB rays of the sun. Naturally occurring minerals like Zinc oxide and Titanium Dioxide are used as sunscreens. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before exposure to suny.</p>

                            <h3>Facial oil and serum</h3>
                            <p>Herbal oils cure skin problems, keep the skin pores in check and lock in moisture for a healthy glow. Facial oils and serums can be used as alternatives to creams.
                                Facial oils made from Ayurvedic herbs are 100% natural. Kumkumadi oil and neem oil are good facial oils.</p>

                            <h3>Face masks </h3>
                            <p>They help deep clean the pores and exfoliate the skin, to achieve a healthy glow.
                                Face masks keep acne, pigmentation, ageing, and other skin issues at bay. They can be used weekly. They absorb oil and can have a mild exfoliating effect. Multani mitti, Ashwagandha, Sandalwood, and Turmeric are used as face masks.</p>

                            <h3>Mukhalepam or Face Pack</h3>
                            <p>The face is massaged with Ayurvedic medicated oil or gel for 15-20 minutes. Thereafter, an even layer of lepam or a freshly prepared face pack is applied. With this pack, ageing is slowed down, wrinkles are reduced, dead cells are removed, and the skin gets a better tone.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Facial treatments</h3>
                            <p>Facial treatment differs from person to person, based on the skin type. It improves your skin's appearance. The massage that is done, improves blood flow and brings nourishing blood to the skin's cells. The treatment is relaxing as well as therapeutic. 
                                When regular facials are given, normal skin remains clear and radiant. Dry skin becomes more hydrated with the steam. Combination skin also shows improvement. Ageing skin is also greatly benefited.</p>

                            <h3>Keshavarna</h3>
                            <p>It is the Ayurvedic hair care therapy promoting hair health, using freshly ground herbs and medicated oils.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurvedic diet for glowing skin</h3>
                            <p>Good diet is helpful in bringing out the healthy glow. Drink 2 litres of water to hydrate your skin. Have seasonal fruits and green leafy vegetables for clean skin. Green tea slows down ageing.</p>
                            <p>Exercise every day.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic beauty care also comprises Rasayana chikitsa and Panchakarma therapy. Warm oils are massaged over the whole body in Abhyangam.</p>
