                            <p>Even if we don't want it, stress and anxiety have crept into our daily lives. When stress is ongoing, things start to go wrong, and it gradually takes a toll on your body and mind. It is also known as chronic stress, and it may be a part of your life as a result of a variety of concerns such as employment, relationships, and other life events.</p>
                            <p>Feeling anxious, having panic attacks, weariness, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, irritability, and other symptoms of stress and anxiety are all extremely frequent. Stress is bad for the human body since it affects you both physically and mentally. It affects the body's chemical system at the micro level by generating imbalances and altering the fundamental normal. Almost all of your body's functions are harmed, including digestion, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, reproductive, and immunological systems.</p>
                            <p>Stress cannot be managed only by taking drugs. There is a comprehensive approach to stress reduction that includes all parts of your life such as the environment, cuisine, lifestyle, sleep, physical activity, and so on.</p>

                            
                            <p>Ayurveda is a science that has been practised for millennia and is founded on the notion of dosha balance. Stress and anxiety are produced by an imbalance in Vata Dosha, according to Ayurveda.</p>

                            
                            <p>These are some popular hints and ideas that will assist you in your daily life.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Focus on your breath</h3>
                            <p>Concentrate on the vital energy in your body that can aid you right away. Practicing breathing methods such as Pranayam or Sama Vritti may do wonders for relieving anxiety.</p>
                            <p>This is a pretty simple procedure that consists of the stages listed below. Sit in a comfortable position and begin to inhale to the count of five. Begin exhaling on the count of five. Just make sure your inhale and exhale times are in sync. Continue this procedure for a few minutes, and you will begin to feel more relaxed and peaceful. You may start employing this approach whenever you are worried. This may be done at the workplace or at home, making it quick and straightforward to relieve tension and anxiety.</p>

                            <h3>Practice Shirodhara</h3>
                            <p>Shirodhara is derived from the Sanskrit terms shiro (head) and dhara (water) in Ayurveda (flow). Pouring heated oil over the forehead has a calming impact on the nervous system and is used in this therapy.</p>
                            <p>This also encourages good blood circulation, and when particular herbs are included, it gives relief from chronic stress, anxiety, sleeplessness, migraines, and other ailments.</p>
                            <p>This procedure allows the mind and body to unwind on a deeper level. According to many studies, Shirodhara induces a feeling of serenity that is quite comparable to the relaxation response experienced in meditation.</p>

                            <h3>Practice Nasya</h3>
                            <p>Nasya is the application of medicinal oil to the nasal passages. It calms these sensitive tissues, improves clear breathing, lowers tension, and increases mental clarity. Pregnant or menstrual women should not practise nasya. Apply three to five drops of Nasya Oil to each nostril each morning.</p>

                            <h3>Pranayama</h3>
                            <p>The subtle essence of the life energy that animates each of us is prana, the vital breath. It pervades every cell and tissue in our body and is carried on and stimulated by the breath. Imbibing prana aids in the restoration of fluidity and vigour to the body's subtle energy channels, as well as the digestion and elimination of stagnation and ama (toxins).</p>
                            <p>Pranayama is one of the finest techniques to wash our tissues in new prana (yogic breathing exercises). Nadi Shodhana is particularly helpful for releasing stored tension, relieving stress, and supporting a healthier mental disposition in the face of everyday challenges.</p>

                            <h3>Yoga</h3>
                            <p>Yoga moves prana in the body, relieves tension, clears stagnation, and promotes fluidity, both in the tissues and the mental and emotional domains. Ayurveda provides a complex approach to yoga that especially helps to balance whichever doshas in your system require the greatest attention.</p>
                            <p>Our Ayurvedic Profile survey may be taken at any time to establish your current level of balance, and our Yoga Department explains how to practise vata-pacifying, pitta-pacifying, and kapha-pacifying yoga. However, if there has been a history of excessive stress, vata- and pitta-calming yoga exercises are frequently the most suited.</p>

                            <h3>Meditation</h3>
                            <p>Imagine being able to see pressures in our life with detachment and clarity, focused on actively responding to them rather than reacting to them.</p>
                            <p>Meditation, via the cultivation of passive awareness, assists us in developing this ability and can guide a far better reaction to stressful situations. A daily meditation practice can genuinely repattern the brain over time, assisting in the rewiring of our reaction to adversity.</p>

                            <h3>Diet</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda also seeks to change your diet and reduce inflammation by doing so. Ayurveda advocates eating according to your prakriti since everybody is unique and has a unique prakriti. Each person should adhere to a diet plan tailored to his or her physique and living preferences.</p>
                            <p>Stress, anxiety, and depression may be extremely draining on your mental and physical health and have a significant impact on your daily life. Ayurveda contains various treatments, herbs, and substances that can help you heal holistically. You can experiment with these herbs and formulations because they have no negative side effects and are non-addictive.</p>
                            <p>Au Revoir, the finest resort in Palakkad and an Ayurvedic treatment centre, provides one of the best Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala for stress management.</p>
