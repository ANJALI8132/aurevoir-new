                            <p>Being in good shape enhances your appearance and brings about a significant improvement in your health.</p>
                            <p>However, owing to an unhealthy lifestyle, obesity has become a serious health concern, nowadays.</p>
                            <p>Through proper diagnosis and effective weight management, obesity can be treated.</p>

                            <h3>Overweight and Obesity</h3>
                            <p>The terms 'Overweight and Obesity' are used in reference to body weight that is greater than what is healthy.</p>
                            <p>Overweight results from extra body fat, extra muscle, bone or water and obesity is due to excessive fat accumulation.</p>
                            <p>Overweight leads to obesity, if not controlled.</p>

                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>Your eating patterns, physical activity, weight history, weight-loss efforts, medicines and other health issues are reviewed.</p>
                            <p>Body mass index(BMI) is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres.</p>
                            <p>BMI Values:</p>
                            <p>Ideal weight : 18.5 - < 25</p>
                            <p>Overweight : 25 - 29.9</p>
                            <p>Obese : 30 and above</p>
                            <p>BMI is not reliable in all cases as it does not measure body fat directly. Many muscular athletes with low body fat  have high BMI.</p>
                            <p>Waist measurement is another criteria to determine obesity. Women who have waist measurement over 35 inches and men with that over 40 inches are considered obese.
                                Blood tests help to rule out certain medical conditions that cause weight gain like Hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) etc.</p>

                            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                            <p>High BMI, excess fat accumulation around the waist, shortness of breath, fatigue, excessive sweating, trouble sleeping, back and joint pain, skin, and negative self-esteem are some of the symptoms of Obesity.</p>

                            <h3>Causes</h3>
                            <p>When there is an energy imbalance, overweight and obesity develop over time.
                            Diseases, characterised by hormonal imbalance like Hyperthyroidism, PCOS, Cushing's syndrome tend to cause obesity. Some genetic disorders also lead to obesity.</p>
                            <p>Osteoarthritis,which tends to bring about low physical activity, causes consequent weight gain.</p>
                            <p>Medications like antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, birth control pills etc. also cause weight gain.</p>

                            <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                            <p>Unhealthy lifestyle in the form of lack of exercise and a sedentary life are major risk factors.</p>
                            <p>Food items with high added sugar, saturated and trans fats contribute to weight increase.
                            Lack of sleep affects the hormones controlling hunger.</p>
                            <p>If you are under excessive and continuous stress the levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, are affected, as a result of which, you eat more. People suffering from depression may overeat to derive emotional comfort. A slower metabolic rate and less muscle mass are the reasons for weight gain when you age.</p>
                            <p>Obesity and overweight can be inherited genetically too.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurvedic Treatment For Weight Loss </h3>
                            <p>Many people look towards the dietary principles and natural remedies as prescribed by Ayurveda for weight loss, because of the reason that it focuses on mindful nutrition, stress reduction, and cultivation of a balanced lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, there are three forms of energy that you need to balance.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Vata - the energy of movement ( space and air)</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Pitta - the energy of metabolism ( fire and water)</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Kapha - the energy of body's structure (earth and water)</h4>
                            <p>The most dominant form of energy is the dosha in your body constitution.</p>
