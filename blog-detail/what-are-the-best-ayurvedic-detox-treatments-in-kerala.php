                            <p>Ayurveda, the 'Science of Life', is one of the world's oldest schools of traditional healing.    
                                Ayurvedic Detox treatments are widely sought after, these days. They help in getting rid of toxins, eventually preventing various illnesses.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Ayurvedic Detox</h3>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, the world is made up of five elements-Vayu(air), Prithvi(earth), Teja(fire), Aakash(space), and Jala(water).</p>
                            <p>Various combinations of each element form three doshas, Vata, Pitta and Kapha which govern the functions of our body.</p>
                            <p>Proper health can be maintained if there is a balance between these three doshas and also the five elements. An imbalance can trigger diseases. Illnesses can also be caused by the imbalance of waste products.</p>
                            <p>Several kinds of toxins are accumulated in our body from the environment, and the food and drinks we consume. In Ayurveda, this toxic accumulation is called Ama.The natural biochemistry and functioning of all the organs are disrupted by these toxins. When this accumulation continues for years, the flow of Prana(vital energy), is blocked, as a result of which, there is an imbalance in the five elements and the three doshas and the mind as well.</p>
                            <p>Detox treatments help in restoring balance to your health.</p>
                            <h3>Ayurvedic Detox Treatment in Kerala : </h3>
                            <p>Following are the therapies that are included in a Detox treatment available in Kerala</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Poorvakarma (Pre operative procedure)</h4>
                            <p>Poorvakarma is the process that prepares the body for detox. The first step is Snehana(oleation) in which the body is saturated with herbal or medicated oils or by ingestion of ghee. Abhyangam(external oleation) consists of vigorous massage over the whole body with medicated herbal oils. Ama is loosened and it moves into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                            <p>The second step is Swedana, in which the channels are dilated. Nadi swedana is the localized application of steam. In Bashpa swedana, steam is applied evenly on the whole body.</p>
                            <p>The last step is Sirodhara, which is the pouring of warm medicated oil in a slow steady stream on the forehead. It improves mental clarity.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Ayurvedic Panchakarma Treatment in Kerala</h4>
                            <p>Panchakarma therapy is the Pradhanakarma.  A formidable Ayurvedic therapy, Panchakarma which  means 'five detox processes' is a therapy that transforms, removes toxins and helps in restoring the body constitution. It rejuvenates your body and strengthens the detox and reestablishes your mind-body unity.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Five Panchakarma Treatments</h4>
                            <p>All the five treatments are not necessary for every individual. The Ayurvedic physicians decide about the appropriate treatments and duration after considering aspects like age,genetics, medical condition, and most importantly the doshic imbalances. </p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Nasyam</h4>
                            <p>Nasya is a nasal cleansing process in which herbal oils or herbal remedies or fumes are administered through the nostrils. The nasal passages get lubricated and the air we breathe becomes moist in a subtle way and that helps to cleanse all your sense organs as well as the cerebral faculties, thereby activating the sense organs and protecting you from the diseases of the head.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Vamana</h4>
                            <p>The digestive system is cleansed by controlled vomiting or purging, through herbal medicinal treatment. This treatment removes the kapha(mucus) toxins accumulated in the body and the respiratory tract. You get relief from congestion, wheezing, and breathlessness as the sinus is cleared after vomiting. Vamana enhances digestion and metabolism.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Virechanam</h4>
                            <p>Through medically induced purgation, intestines are cleansed. Liver, gallbladder, and gastrointestinal tract are cleansed from excessive toxic and metabolic waste(pitta) using laxative medicines. As per the condition, herbal medicines are given in specific amounts. Immunity is improved, appetite is increased, metabolism is regulated, healthy digestion is enhanced and the intensity of chronic diseases is minimised.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Vasthi</h4>
                            <p>Warm Ayurvedic herbal oils or decoctions are introduced into the colon through rectum to induce enema, for the elimination of toxins accumulated in the intestines and colon. Vasti is a localised and symptomatic treatment.</p>
                            <p>This treatment nourishes the colonic flora and brings about a balance in the body. It is considered one of the best remedies for numerous psycho-somatic diseases.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Rakta moksha</h4>
                            <p>Blood is detoxified effectively in this treatment. Small quantities of impure blood are removed to neutralize accumulated toxins of many blood-borne diseases, by using two main techniques- by metallic instruments(Shastra Visravana) and using leeches( Anushastra Visravana).</p>
                            <p>Rakta moksha therapy is both curative as well as preventive.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Paschat Karma</h4>
                            <p>It involves rejuvenation therapies with the use of Rasayanas or herbal preparations. It includes diet and regimen changes.</p>
                            <p>Changes are also brought about in diet, lifestyle, medication etc.</p>
                            <h3>Who can benefit from Panchakarma Detox</h3>
                            <p>It is the foundational therapy to cure all chronic illnesses. But Panchakarma detox is also for general well-being. Those leading a stressed lifestyle, taking prescription medicines for a long period, eating unhealthy diet, suffering from lack of sleep and ailments like Arthritis, Rheumatism, Chronic digestive problems, constipation, migraine etc. can undergo Panchakarma therapy.</p>
                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>When toxins are eliminated, the natural biochemistry of the body is restored, metabolism is improved, which helps the Prana body to stay energetic. Through regular massages, lactic acid is removed from muscles and joints. Hormonal balance is regained and blood circulation is improved helping to restore appetite, sleep quality, concentration and memory.</p>
