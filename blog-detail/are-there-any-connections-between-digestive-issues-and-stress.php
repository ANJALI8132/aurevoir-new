                            <p>Do you feel butterflies in your stomach! The gut, your second brain seems to be responding to stress. The key to a healthy and fit body lies in your digestion capacities. There can be some visible physical symptoms, especially in abdominal twinge that can be an indicator for depression. Do breathe a sigh of relief and get on with your life.</p>
                            <p>Our bodies are well equipped to manage stress in small doses, but when that stress becomes long- term or severe, it can have serious effects on your body. In more serious cases, stress may bring about a drop in blood flow and oxygen to the abdomen, which could lead to cramping, inflammation, or an imbalance of gut bacteria.</p>
                            <p>Certain stressful life events have been associated with the onset or symptom exacerbation in some of the most common chronic diseases of the digestive system, including functional gastrointestinal maladies, Irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel ailments.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Empty your mind and ease your gut</h3>
                            <p>We have hundreds of millions of neurons in our gut which can function fairly
                            independently and are in constant communication with the brain—explaining the ability to get 'butterflies' in the stomach. The brain-gut communication can be affected by stress, and may trigger pain, bloating, and other gut discomfort to be felt more easily.</p>
                            <p>Millions of bacterial populations in the gut can also influence the brain’s health, which can impact the ability to think and affect emotions. Your mood can get influenced by the changes in gut bacteria thus causing stress. Thus, both the gut nerves and bacteria strongly influence the brain and vice versa.</p>
                            <p>Stress in early stages of life can change the development of the nervous system as well as the way of reactions of the body towards stress. This may lead to increased risk for future gut diseases or dysfunctioning.</p>


                            <h3>Esophagus</h3>
                            <p>You might have noticed individuals in stress eating much more or much less than usual. Heartburn or acid reflux will be the result of such changes. The severity of regularly occurring heartburn pain also may be increased due to stress.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Stomach</h3>
                            <p>Stress leads to intense pain, bloating, nausea, and other discomforts in the stomach more easily. If the stress is intense enough, there can also be a tendency of vomiting. Further, an unnecessary increase or decrease in appetite can also be caused by stress.</p>
                            <p>Unhygienic and unhealthy diets may in turn deteriorate one’s mood. Stress leads to a tendency of swallowing foods or increasing the amount of air that is swallowed, which increases burping, gassiness, and bloating.</p>

                            <h3>Bowel</h3>
                            <p>Stress can also make pain, bloating, or discomfort sensed more freely in the bowels.
                            Absorption of necessary nutrients by the intestines and the digestion can get affected due to stress. Gas production related to nutrient immersion may also get accelerated in turn by this.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurveda for Improving Digestion Power</h3>
                            <p>Incorporating a few remedies suggested by Ayurveda, in your daily regime in turn will
