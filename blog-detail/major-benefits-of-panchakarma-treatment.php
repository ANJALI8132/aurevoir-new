                            <h3>Panchakarma treatment</h3>
                            <p>Panchakarma in Sanskrit means, 'five  processes'. These are the primary cleansing processes mentioned in Ayurveda. Panchakarma focuses on the removal of toxins and the vitiated doshas,  helps in restoring the body constitution and builds the immune system. It also rejuvenates your body and reestablishes your mind-body unity. Ayurvedic Panchakarma treatment in Kerala is a much sought detox program.</p>

Many toxins get accumulated in our body from various sources. These toxins or ama affect the natural biochemistry and functioning of different organs. The flow of Prana (vital energy) is blocked when accumulation continues over years. An imbalance in the five elements and the three doshas(vata, pitta and kapha) results. Panchakarma helps to eliminate these toxins and rejuvenate the body, as a result of which the inner balance and vitality is restored.</p>

                            <p><strong>Vasthi - </strong>Warm Ayurvedic herbal oils or decoctions are administered to induce enema, for the elimination of toxins accumulated in the intestines and colon.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rakta moksha - </strong>Blood is detoxified effectively by this treatment. Impure blood is removed from the bloodstream by the process of bloodletting.</p>
