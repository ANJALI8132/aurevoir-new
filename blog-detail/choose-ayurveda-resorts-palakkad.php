                            <p>Ayurveda is an ancient way of living that attempts to provide balance and wellbeing to the body. It is based on the notion that all living things have a "dosha" - a unique blend of energies known as "vata," "pitta," and "kapha." It is extensively practised in India. The Sanskrit term 'dosha' is arguably the most well-known Ayurvedic principle today, and the essential purpose of Ayurvedic practise is to preserve your own intrinsic 'doshic' balance."</p>
