                            <p>Who doesn't desire to possess a naturally glowing and healthy skin? However, factors like unhealthy diet and lifestyle, pollution, stress, etc act as impediments for acquiring the same.</p>

                            <p>The age-old traditional goodness of Ayurveda can help you attain a radiant skin. Simple herbal formulations, therapies, a regular skincare regimen, nutritious diet and healthy lifestyle are helpful in the process.</p>

                            <h3>Best Skin Care tips for face and body</h3>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, each individual is different. Your skin type is different from others and what works for them may not work for you. <a href="https://aurevoir.co.in/ayurvedic-beauty-treatment">Ayurvedic beauty treatment in Kerala</a> follows the age old principles of Ayurveda and has long-lasting benefits. Following skin care tips can help you own the perfect skin you wished for:</p>

                            <h3>Know your Skin type and how it responds to weather</h3>
                            <p>As per Ayurveda, your skin type is based on the prominence of three doshas - vata (wind), pitta (fire), and kapha (water and earth).</p>
                            <p>Vata Skin Type -  Your skin is thin, dry and rough. It has fine pores and is cool to touch. It is prone to uneven tone, wrinkles, flakiness, fine lines, ageing and stress.</p>
                            <p>Pitta Skin Type-  You tend to have thicker, oily skin that's prone to rashes and acne and is warm to touch. You are less tolerant to heat and more subjected to tanning, sun burns, and sun spots.</p>
                            Kapha Skin Type - Your skin will be thicker, cold, and dull, with excessive oiliness, and prone to pimples, whiteheads, cystic acne, and water retention. Your skin pores will be large, due to which dirt can get clogged in them.

                            <h3>Learn to treat your doshas</h3>
                            <p>Based on your doshas you can practice the following beauty tips:</p>
                            <p>Vata Skin Type - As your skin lacks the ability to retain moisture, ensure that it is moisturized and hydrated. Drink plenty of water and apply natural and nourishing moisturisers and creams. In winters, you can apply coconut oil.</p>
                            <p>Pitta Skin Type - You must protect your skin from excessive sun exposure as your skin is sensitive. Natural cleansers and creams suitable for sensitive skin must be used.</p>
                            <p>Kapha Skin Type - You must cleanse your skin twice everyday, as it is prone to attracting oil and dirt. You must also exfoliate your face once or twice a week.</p>

                            <h3>Experience the goodness of milk</h3>
                            <p>An irritated or inflamed skin can be soothed and calmed by having a milk bath. Milk softens and moisturizes. Milk is a great cleanser. Dip a cotton ball in milk and rub gently over the face and neck once a day. Full-fat milk or cream-based masks soothe and nourish your skin.</p>

                            <p>Scrub your skin while bathing with a dry brush</p>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, you must use a natural bristle dry brush on your body for a toned and firm skin. Starting from your feet, massage towards the heart in upward, circular motions towards the heart and rinse it off.</p>
                            <p>For Vata and Pitta skin types, a softer brush that is effective but less abrasive, must be used.</p>

                            <h3>Use Aloe vera</h3>
                            <p>Aloe vera juice can be applied for mild sunburns. Aloe vera also makes your skin smooth, supple, and younger-looking. You can use it as a toner. Apply aloe vera on your face and neck, leave it on for 15-20 minutes and rinse it off. You can consume it in the form of juice too.</p>

                            <h3>Oil massage</h3>
                            <p>An Ayurvedic massage boosts the radiance of your skin. Abhyanga is a warm oil massage that lubricates your skin, cleanses your sweat glands, and promotes blood circulation. Eladi, Kumkumadi, or Nalpamaradi oil are used for massaging. Sesame or organic coconut oil can also be used.</p>

                            <h3>Use Facial oils</h3>
                            <p>You can choose a natural facial oil based on your skin type, and use it regularly. Kumkumadi oil, suitable for all skin types, balances your dosha, detoxes your skin, and provides a youthful nourished glow.</p>

                            <h3>Practice a Regular Skin Care Regimen</h3>
                            <p>You must follow the essential steps of your daily skin care routine..</p>

                            <h3>Cleansing</h3>
                            <p>It is the process of removing dead skin cells, sweat, oil, diet and product build-up from the skin. Do it twice or thrice a day using natural cleansers. They remove impurities without affecting the natural oils present in the skin.</p>
                            <p>Raw milk, Aloe vera, Neem, Tulsi, Sandalwood are good cleansing agents.</p>

                            <h3>Toning</h3>
                            <p>With the help of a face toner, the moisture in your skin can be sealed, as it closes the pores. Your skin is protected from environmental pollutants and it remains hydrated for a longer time. Rose water is a natural toner. Spray it on your face a few times a day. Fresh orange juice is a good skin toner for oily skin.</p>

                            <h3>Moisturizing</h3>
                            <p>Moisturizing is the process of hydrating and nourishing the skin, so as to prevent extreme oiliness or dryness. Use natural ingredients like coconut milk, sesame oil, essential oils for the purpose of moisturizing. The right moisturizer helps to hide the blemishes naturally and maintains your skin's pH.</p>

                            <h3>Have an Ayurvedic diet </h3>
                            <p>Eat fruits and vegetables containing powerful oxidants. Have food that is low in glycemic index, because high glycemic foods destroy collagen and cause wrinkles. Drink 2 litres of water to hydrate your skin.</p>

                            <h3>Use Herbal lepanam and face masks</h3>
                            <p>Herbal paste made of turmeric, licorice, and grain powders is applied over the body. It purifies your skin and gives glowing skin. It is best for dull and dry skin. Different face masks are also applied.</p>

                            <h3>Sleep for 7-8 hours</h3>
                            <p>Adequate sleep is essential for the production of collagen and elastin protein. Your skin is kept tight and radiant.</p>

                            <h3>Exercise</h3>
                            <p>Exercise for 30 minutes to improve blood circulation.</p>
