                            <h3>Healthier and conscious way of life</h3>
                            <p>At home, there are several distractions, due to which, a healthier regime is difficult to adopt. But with retreats, a healthy and holistic approach is associated, as they combine healing therapies, Yoga, meditation and healthy meals.</p>

                            <p>Decision making, in this modern world, is greatly affected by multitasking and addiction to the digital world.
