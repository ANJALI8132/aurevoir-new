                            <p>The land of Yoga-India, has different social customs and rituals reflecting a love for ecological balance, forbearance towards different systems of study and a compassionate outlook towards all creations. Yoga's origin can be traced thousands of eras ago, long before the first persuasions or belief systems were born. One of the most common misinterpretations about yoga is that it's linked with religion. Yoga is a holistic scientific approach of living life which transforms the whole actuality and has no strings attached to any faith or religion or conversion. Yoga sadhana is considered as a life style and acts as medicine for a stressful life. Millions and millions of people of all faiths across the globe have been advantaged by the practice of Yoga which has been saved and promoted by the great eminent Yoga acharyas from ancient time to this date.</p>

                            <p>Au Revoir Wellness resort, one among the blooming ayurvedic resorts in Palakkad, Kerala gives you a unique experience of health retreat with ayurveda and assures you a vibrant reformation through yoga and meditation. The ayurvedic treatment package is designed so as to inspire, to feel the serenity of yogic practices that go hand in hand with Ayurveda.</p>

                            <p>We have heard of Yogis pronouncing that the practice of Yoga helped them to attain life force benefits. Yoga has mending benefits and helps us to enhance the life force energy which improves our physical health, internal health and well- being.'Prana', breath of life or life force energy is the subtle element underpinning the fabric of all creation. Yoga rejuvenates us through its practices of pranic mending.</p>

                            <p>Gym sessions infrequently offer internal stimulation and act more or less on the external appearance and tone the muscles. However, the gym may give you the results, if your goal is to build muscles. Since strength training is generally explosive, it activates your fast-twitch muscle filaments contrary to classic yoga. Yoga, with its positions taking you to hold acts for a lasting period and spark slow-twitch muscle filaments.</p>

                            <p>Gym sessions concentrate on boosting your cardiovascular health without any focus on the aspect of internal health. Gym makes you feel tired while Yoga revitalizes you and helps in digestion. The idea of yoga practice is to challenge yourself physically, but not to feel overwhelmed. Yoga, once mastered, can be done from anywhere while you travel, whereas a gym needs proper equipment and can not be performed without them.</p>

                            <p>Yoga detoxifies the body from within and also provides relief against intestinal disorders. Gym workouts do not help to get rid of any conditions that are developing internally as they involve perfecting physical fitness. Gym exercises do not connect the mind, body, and soul, unlike yoga.Yoga looks into the treatment of eating ailments that promote a positive body image and esteem. Yoga is therapeutic and cultivates a regulated and balanced lifestyle by destressing the mind and body. It precisely benefits your body, and also promotes healthy eating practices which automatically decreases the chances of getting affected by any conditions. Also, by promoting healthy eating habits you will be suitable to maintain your blood sugar position or blood pressure position, which is one of the main causes of a cardiac arrest.</p>
                            
                            <p>Rehearsing yoga has been proved to increase awareness in distinct areas of a person's life. Yoga focuses on the five aspects, i.e. physical, internal, emotional, social and spiritual, which should work harmoniously to build a personality. The muscle stretching promoted by yoga is proven to improve a range of motion, alignment of bones and joints, and strengthen the connective tissues – all of which boost performance, and you'll see a world of difference after each session.</p>

                            <p>Ayurveda as the family wisdom to yoga can form a total system of physical, emotional and spiritual well-being when rehearsed together. Kerala, the god’s own country has numerous Ayurveda resorts extending Wellness retreats with Yoga. Aurevoir is one of the stylish health retreat centers & Ayurvedic resorts in Palakkad with a peaceful and serene terrain. A place where you get expert guidance to rejuvenate your body and mind and help to manage your stress and to cure colorful health issues.</p>

                            <p>As Yoga has its origin in India, it preserves a tradition which includes exponents for training. Yoga practice requires supervision as it deals with complete body reformation with specific postures and 'Asanas', and can have reverse effects when indulged in incorrectly. When we take something from one tradition and transplant it without its ethical warnings, we lose something in the course. Yoga centers in Kerala enunciate that Yoga is not bare exercises with bills attending your body development. They assure you to train how to control mind, body and soul to attain inner peace and strength in the stylish way possible. Why is it important to find the right place to learn yoga from experts? Yoga comprises abstinence, observances, yoga postures, breath control, pullout of the senses, attention, contemplation and immersion. As we aim to seek balance between mind, body and soul through yoga, we need an enlightened tutor to guide us, therefore essential to find the right place to find an expert.</p>

                            <p>We've forgotten to glance at life for the sole purpose of living and are inching towards a complaint-ridden old age, slightly surviving every moment pointing to wrong lifestyles. Western drugs do caution our everyday distemper, but it remotely fails to feed a holistic health. A holistic approach to health and fitness brings a positive energy in us that works as an indispensable element to fuel our minds and bodies for a meaningful life. Numerous yoga and meditation centers in Kerala are promising to provide health retreat through a combination of packages. Au Revoir stands out with its wellness retreat packages, allowing you to enjoy the natural benefits of ayurveda in a serene environment.</p>
