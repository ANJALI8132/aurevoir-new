                            <p>It is a well-known fact that Ayurveda is completely focused on wellness.</p>
                            <p>Rejuvenation therapy, as the name suggests, has a rejuvenating effect on a person and enhances both physical and mental well-being. It is a holistic Ayurvedic healthcare treatment.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic Rejuvenation therapy in Kerala focuses on restoring one's health, youthfulness and wellness, completely revitalizing the body, helping it regain and maintain health, eliminating the ill-effects of all previous disorders.</p>
                            <p>The therapy is also called Rasayana chikitsa. Rasayana means 'the nourishing pathway'. It treats nutrient deficiencies, with respect to the constituent elements of the body.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits</h3>
                            <p>Rejuvenation therapy has many benefits. It is more beneficial after the body has been on a detoxification treatment such as Panchakarma.</p>

                            <ul style="padding-left: 20px">
                                <li>It improves the functioning of the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and the circulatory system.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Though Rejuvenation therapy is a cure for many diseases, you can undergo this therapy even if you are not ill.</p>
                            <p>If you wish to restore wellness, feel young and energetic, relax, de-stress, and take a break from your hectic lifestyle, Rejuvenation therapy is for you.</p>
                            <p>Through Rejuvenation therapy, kapha, pitta, and kapha doshas are balanced and the body is brought to a state of equilibrium. Rejuvenation therapy protects the body from ageing and enables it to fight against pathogens. The herbs used contain antioxidants that prevent damage caused by free radicals.</p>
