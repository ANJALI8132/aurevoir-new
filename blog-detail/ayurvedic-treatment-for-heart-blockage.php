                            <p>Can you live with heart disease normally? If you are concerned about your future Ayurveda has its remedies to help you. </p>

                                <p>Heart blockage is the most common heart disease that is rapidly quickening and causes premature death in the present era. Comparatively, men are more likely to have heart blockages than women. Patients nowadays regularly look for different traditional treatments which include medicines, heart bypass surgery, or stenting. </p>
                                
                                <p>Our heart muscles need a regular blood supply, oxygen, and nutrients to function properly. The blockage happens due to the building up of the cells, fat, and cholesterol which is known as plaque. This ends up in a lack of blood supply to the heart muscles. Several treatments are available in Ayurveda to cure the problem of heart blockage.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h3>Relation between Fat and Heart Blockage </h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda mentions Medo Vrudhi (a pathological increase of fat) accumulating in the coronary artery vessels causing heart blockage. This causes ischemia in the heart muscles. It is a condition in which the blood flow and oxygen are reduced or restricted in a part of the body. Irregular heart rhythm, shortness of breath, and chest pain are the symptoms of ischemia. It may lead to a blood clot in the artery and can cause a heart attack.</p>


                       

                                <p>The signs of ischemia will take time to appear, but it gradually reduces the heart muscle's ability to pump blood. An unexpected, severe blockage of one of the heart's arteries can lead to a heart attack. Suffering from ischemia for a long time can lead to irregular heartbeat and heart failure. Ayurveda is offering treatment for heart blockage by observing the lifestyle and one's state of the body. It recommends possible alterations along with the prescription of the best ayurvedic medicines.</p>
                                

                            <h3>Treatments in Ayurveda</h3>
                            <p>Once coronary artery disease is diagnosed, there are several ways of treatment that includes lifestyle changes, medication, procedure, or surgery.
                            </p>
                            <strong> Lifestyle Changes:</strong>
                            <p> It also includes changes in habits like strong restrictions on smoking, changes in diet, and bringing in a routine of exercise in your daily life.</p>

                            <strong>Obesity:</strong> 
                            <p> Ayurveda explains obesity as the effect of the increase of fat tissue. Obesity may not have improved to the level of affecting serious damage in the body to be called a disease. But it can be an indication that the body tissues and organs are in danger. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for heart disease.</p>
                            <p>Obesity and Cardiac Disorders are 2 sides of the same coin. They are frequently analyzed as inter-related diseases. Ayurveda centers dealing with Ayurvedic treatment for weight loss in Kerala are offering a complete wellness program to keep you healthy.</p>
                        

                            <strong>Ayurvedic Approach:</strong> 

                            <p>Sometimes a person may be lean but may have coronary artery disease or higher cholesterol levels. We can’t observe these conditions in some obese persons, and still, they may be more in danger of having these problems. But, in such cases also blockage treatment is possible with Ayurveda.</p>
                        
                        
                            <h3>                        
                                Cure Heart Blockage without Surgery</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda focuses on lifestyle management and diet regulation to help in restoring the balance of various systems of the body. It has effective remedies for heart blockages to reduce arterial blockages and improve cardiovascular health. Ayurvedic medicines have no side effects also.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic treatments do not use any tools that break the skin or physically enter the body for fixing any stent or for bypass surgery.</p>
                            <p>Some of the ayurvedic treatments for heart blockage control are Snehan (Oleation), Swedan (fomentation), and Basti (medicated enema). These treatments help to boost oxygen uptake and enhance cardiorespiratory function.</p>
                             <p>Ayurvedic remedies are effective even in cases of chronic heart failure. They help to improve the quality of patient’s life and reduce their dependency on drugs.  In addition, patients with heart blockages who have led to Ischemia can benefit from these treatments to boost blood delivery to the heart.  Thus it reduces the signs and symptoms of chest pain.</p>   

                             

                            <h3>  Healthy Tips for a Healthy Heart</h3>
                            <p>A daily walk for 30-45 minutes can improve your overall health normally. Ayurveda suggests bringing changes in your lifestyle with some simple home remedies. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ayurveda also recommends following a healthy diet to maintain the heart and prevent diseases. Regular intake of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents like turmeric, ginger, garlic, etc. can help you prevent piling up of toxic diets in the artery.
                                </p>
                            <p>Including vegetables in your diet, such as ridge gourd, bottle gourd, ivy gourd, snake gourd, pumpkin, leafy veggies, and so forth and proteins inclusive of green gram, lentils, tofu, millet, rice barley, etc. will help to eliminate toxins and blockage in artery very fast.  
                            </p>
                            <p>Excluding some of the fruits like tomatoes, oranges, pineapples, lemons, grapefruits, vinegar, etc from your diet can help you care for your heart.  Also, foods such as maida, red meat that are hard to digest, and fermented food like yogurt, alcohol, and cheese should be avoided.
                            </p>
                            <p>Heart diseases don't happen overnight. They are constructed over the years, relying on lifestyle, food patterns, exercise, and much more.
