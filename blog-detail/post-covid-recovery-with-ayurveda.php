                            <p>The Corona outbreak, when declared a pandemic in March - 2020, by the World Health Organisation, the people worldwide were unaware of this contagious disease's unexplored lethality and its adverse long-lasting impact on health. The overabundance of information and global misinformation made it difficult to deal with the situation, turning people into more panic with massive destruction of livelihoods.</p>
                            <p>Later, protocols for the prevention and management of early COVID -19 with the best available practices and knowledge were designed by traditional medicine systems across the world. The Ministry of Ayush (Government of India) released the National Clinical Management Protocol for Ayurveda and Yoga, based on knowledge from Ayurveda treatises.</p>

                            <h3>Ayur Raksha Clinics and Task Forces</h3>
                            <p>Kerala, even being a small province of India has gained global attraction by implementing Ayur Raksha Clinics and task forces across the state. As increasing the bodyâ€™s immunity was the way to prevent COVID, Ayurveda received worldwide acceptance in managing uncomplicated early COVID-19 cases of infection and post covid treatment for those recovering from COVID.</p>

                            <h3>Post - Covid Health Issues</h3>
                            <p>The recovered COVID-19 patients after acute illness, are observed to continue with various signs and symptoms including cough and fatigue.  Breathing problems, chest pain, neurocognitive difficulties, muscle pains, weakness, gastrointestinal issues, and metabolic disruption are some of the other reported symptoms.</p>
                            <p>The recovered COVID-19 patients after acute illness, are observed to continue with various signs and symptoms including cough and fatigue.  Breathing problems, chest pain, neurocognitive difficulties, muscle pains, weakness, gastrointestinal issues, and metabolic disruption are some of the other reported symptoms.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurvedic Healing</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda says, there will be 'Dhatu-Kshaya' and 'Agnimandya Avastha'  after COVID 19 infection. Hence, to combat the residual effects of the virus on the body, one must administer Rasayana drugs like Draksha, Amalaki, and Guduchi for a minimum of 45 days, and in case of Diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite, drugs like Shadanga Paneeya should be taken.</p>
                            <p>Post-COVID management protocol includes immunity promoting AYUSH medicines like Ayush Kwath, Samshamani, and intake of immunity boosters like Ashwagandha and Amla fruit also is suggested. Recommendations of practices like consumption of milk with turmeric and gargling with turmeric and salt are extended, which have proven effective.</p>
                            <p>The Ministry of AYUSH highly recommends the use of Chyawanprash under the direction of a Registered Ayurveda physician, as effective during the post-recovery period. Ayurvedic treatments along with the regular practice of Yogasana, Pranayama, and Meditation as directed by health practitioners are proven the best remedy to achieve mental stability and resolve post covid issues at the earliest.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda suggests the inclusion of all six tastes - Shadrasatmaka, in the diet by adding ginger, turmeric, pepper, cinnamon, Indian gooseberry, and mint to boost immunity. Diet has a major role in Ayurveda which should be strictly followed during medication</p>

                            <h3>Panchakarma:</h3>
                            <p>Panchakarma, the five purificatory procedures in Ayurveda, helps to manage the body systems and organs which would have been affected by infection of CoronaVirus.</p>
                            <p>Respiratory conditions - Panchakarma specifically focuses on correcting the metabolism and digestive system by purifying the body by the expulsion of doshas mentioned by Ayurveda. Procedures of oil massage and steam baths also help in rejuvenating and expelling toxic wastes from the body.</p>
                            <p>Neurological conditions - Treatments like karma basti and shirodhara in Ayurveda work out well in the treatment of neurological conditions. A variety of medicated powder is used for a whole-body massage for rejuvenation of the body.</p>
                            <p>Musculoskeletal and Cardiac conditions - One of the prominent signs of post covid problems is consistent muscle and body pain. Severe imbalance in cardiac conditions also can be expected after recovering from Covid.</p>
                            <p>Psychological conditions - Ayurveda therapy eradicates vitiated doshas from the nervous system and enhances the efficiency of the nervous system. People are reported to experience fatigue, cough, insomnia, and drowsiness even after many months of turning COVID negative.</p>
                            <p>Apart from Panchakarma, to fight the viral entry in the preliminary stage, Ayurveda also recommends following some daily routines to build immunity in oneself:</p>

                            <ul style="padding-left: 20px" class="mb-2">
                                <li>Eating nutritious and balanced food, preferably easy to digest.</li>
                                <li>Adequate consumption of warm water.</li>
                                <li>Intake of immunity promoting Ayurveda supplements prescribed by a qualified practitioner.</li>
                                <li>Meditation, and yoga practices, as much as your health permits.</li>
                                <li>A walk in the morning or evening walks at a relaxed pace.</li>
                                <li>Sufficient sleep and rest</li>
                                <li>Adequate consumption of turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garlic.</li>
                                <li>Inclusion of herbal teas daily.</li>
                                <li>Inhalation of steam with medicinal herbs</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Ayurveda strictly restricts the consumption of processed food, fast food, and food that are high in salt and sugar and recommends limiting your intake of soft drinks or sodas that are high in sugar. Smoking, alcohol, and other addictive substances are mentioned to be avoided and suggested not to compromise with, until the complete recovery from post covid issues.</p>
                            <p>A new term - 'The Kerala Model' has been quoted nationwide considering the social development and crisis management techniques introduced by the state. Ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala are offering rejuvenation and post covid recovery treatment assuring a wellness retreat experience.</p>
