                            <p>Are you forgetting to nurture yourself? Everyone of us wants to look good. Paying attention to your soul and body is essential to feel confident and to look good. We need to take some moments to heal the spirit and allow our soul to settle down, breathe, balance out and rejuvenate. A bit of preening is essential as it reflects our overall sense of well-being.

                            </p>
                             <p>Our body is a self-healing, self-renewing, self-cleansing organism. Vibrant well-being is its natural state, if the right conditions are created. But do we live under natural conditions? We have departed from the ways of nature and are forcing our body and soul to get along with the new system.The toxicity of our planet is an inconvenient truth and is undeniable. The food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, are loaded with toxic chemicals that alone or in combination cause disease, suffering and even death.
    </p>
    <p>
When we realise the necessity to remove these obstacles and add what is lacking, our bodies bounce back into health as if by magic. This enables the body to heal, regenerate and even rejuvenate itself. As a foundation therapy, Ayurvedic Pachakarma detox is used to cure all illnesses and for ensuring general well-being.

                            <h3>Flush Out Toxins From The Body through Ayurveda
</h3>
                            <p>Our body  has  the  innate  ability  to efficiently  process  and  remove   these   waste materials, including the vitiated Doshas. However due  to  one’s repeated  dietary indiscretions, poor exercise patterns, lifestyle, and genetic predisposition the digestive enzymes, metabolic co-factors, hormones, and against which regulate the body’s internal homeostasis become disorganized. Panchakarma, being one of the most popular Ayurvedic treatments in India, follows its basic principle of purification of the body through 'five actions' or 'five treatments'. It helps the body to release all toxins that are left by diseases, poor nutrition and environmental impurities.


                                .</p>

                            <p> Vamana karma helps to purify the thoracic region of our body by eliminating vitiated doshas, through induced therapeutic vomiting. This is focussing on the kapha dosha by administration of Vamaka Dravyas, through oral route.

                            <p>Another technique of purification is Basti Karma in which Basti Dravyas are administered through various routes, i.e. rectum, vagina or urethra. It is a specific therapy for Vata dosha.

                            </p>

                            <h3>
The Objectives of Panchakarma Therapy:
    </h3>

    <p>Preventive - Maintaining the
positive health as a preventive therapy.</p>

<p>Rejuvenation - therapy for reviving, regenerating and revitalising of all body Dhatus.</p>

<p>Curative - Therapy for curing various diseases.</p>

<h3>The Seasonal Panchakarma
    </h3>

                            <p>
In order to be benefited by the Panchakarma, Vedic texts recommend treatments to be done three to four times a year as per the season. As each season is either a time for detoxification or rejuvenation, Panchakarma performed in different seasons provides different benefits.

                            </p>
                            <p>Changes in seasons have a significant impact on the human body. The changes in the climate can cause certain diseases to get activated and affect individuals. Ritu-charyas in Ayurveda direct humans to keep themselves protected from diseases that can occur due to climatic changes. Ayurveda treatment can be done based on the climate that is dominant in respective geographic locations.

                            </p>
        <p>Dosha of vata predominates during the dry/dehydrating heat of the summer and aggravates during the rainy season. Pitha dosha predominates during the rainy season and aggravates during autumn when the heat returns. Kapha dosha predominates during the cold season and aggravates during spring.

    </p>

    <p>Rejuvenation for the nervous system is focussed by Panchakarma in winter to free us from a stressful lifestyle. Panchakarma cleanses our body in spring, removes all the excess fat and proteins which our body had stored in the winter months. Consumption of more greens, bitter roots, berries and cherries at this time helps in cleansing the digestive and respiratory tracts. Other detox periods are summer and fall. Due to increase in temperature, the body swells and becomes ready for a deep tissue detox. At the latter stage our blood vessels and liver accumulate toxins, to be eliminated in fall.
    </p>
