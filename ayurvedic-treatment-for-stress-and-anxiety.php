                            <p>It is a popular saying that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body. Owing to several factors, most people experience  stress and anxiety from time to time. </p>
                            
                            <h3>What is Stress and Anxiety?</h3>
                            <p>Stress and anxiety are flip sides of the same coin.</p>
                            <p>Most of us feel down at times. We also feel anxious now and then. That is normal. Stress is experienced when multiple competing demands are placed on your brain or physical body. Any event that makes you feel frustrated or nervous can trigger the feeling of stress. Anxiety is the fear of a future situation and involves muscle tension and avoidance behaviour.</p>
                            <p>Stress and anxiety in the short term can help you overcome a challenge or dangerous situation. A feeling of anxiety can motivate you to do things that you need to.</p>
                            <p>Worrying about finding a job, nervousness before a big exam, or being embarrassed in certain social situations are some everyday examples of stress and anxiety.</p>
                            <p>But, if stress and anxiety start interfering with your daily life, you must take it seriously. If some irrational fears are making you avoid situations, if you are worrying constantly, or experiencing severe anxiety about a tragic event, weeks after it happened, it may be time to seek help.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>There is no single test that can diagnose stress or anxiety.</p>
                            <p>Your doctor performs a physical exam that will reveal the overall state of health, for diagnosis.</p>
                            <p>A screening test is then performed in which you are asked a series of questions about your mood, appetite, sleep pattern, activity level and thoughts.</p>

                            <h3>Symptoms of Stress and Anxiety</h3>
                            <p>Some of the physical symptoms include:</p>

                            <h3>Causes of Stress and Anxiety</h3>
                            <p>Most of the time, stress and anxiety occur after particular life events, and go away. Common causes include life events like:</p>

                            <p>Drugs containing stimulants, regular use of caffeine, illicit drugs, thyroid medications, asthma inhalers, diet pills etc. can worsen the symptoms of stress and anxiety.</p>

                            <h3>Stress-and Anxiety-related disorders</h3>
                            <p>When stress and anxiety occur frequently, or seem out of proportion to the stressor, it is an indication of an anxiety disorder, wherein, anxiety and stress persist on a daily basis and for a prolonged time.</p>

                            <h3>Treatment of Stress and Anxiety in Ayurveda</h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda is one of the efficient ways, along with allopathy, to deal with stress and anxiety. Body and mind are seen as reflections of each other, by Ayurveda.</p>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, stress and anxiety are caused by an imbalance in vata dosha. Excessive vata affects the Mano vaha srota, the channel of the mind.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic treatment for stress relief in Kerala aims at avoiding stress and strengthening the body's adaptive power to deal with stress.</p>
                            <p>A proper counselling is the first step. Your detailed history will be examined by your doctor and then recommend ayurveda therapies,  rejuvenation programs, diet and lifestyle modification.</p>
                            <p>Ayurvedic therapies along with Yoga and Pranayama are helpful in reversing or stopping the progression of stress and anxiety.</p>

                            <h3>Effective Therapies </h3>
                            <h4 class="color-g"><strong>Abhyangam </strong>- Dosha-specific medicated herbal oils are used for a full body massage that  improves blood circulation and flushes out toxins. Vital pressure points are stimulated. The resulting nervous stimulation reduces stress.</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g"><strong>Nasyam </strong>- Through nostrils, medicated drugs or oils are administered. The vital centres of the brain that regulate emotions, are stimulated.</h4>
