                            <p>Ayurveda recommends several easy yet powerful solutions to help you lose weight in 
                                a healthy way. Being overweight, according to Ayurveda, may indicate an overabundance
                                 of kapha dosha. Being overweight can aggravate kapha in the body even more; consequently,
                                  it is critical to balance this dosha by adhering to particular guidelines. This health strategy 
                                  does not prioritise short-term gains, so you won't have to starve yourself or restrict the range 
                                  of things you may eat. Instead, it focuses on adhering to a simple concept that will not only help 
                                  you reduce weight but also promote overall health. You can find a number of Ayurvedic treatment for
                                   weight loss in Kerala. Au- Revoir is one such Health Retreat in Kerala, helping people to lose weight 
                                   with Ayurvedic practices. </p>
                            <p>The five elements are used to create the three Ayurvedic doshas: space, air, fire, water, and earth. Each element has a unique set of features or attributes.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Vata (air and space):</h4> Vatas are frequently regarded as being creative, passionate, or expressive. Dry, light, chilly, and rough are some of the characteristics.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g"> Pitta (fire and water):</h4> Pittas are known for their intelligence, enthusiasm, and energy. Sharp, hot, liquid, and mobile are some of the characteristics.</p>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Kapha (earth and water):</h4> Kaphas are frequently described as peaceful, loving, or sluggish. Moisture, heavy, squishy, and static are some of the characteristics.</p>

                            
                            
                            <p>When you become acquainted with each dosha, you may discover that one sounds more like the attributes you embody. Many people discover that they have two dominant doshas.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurvedic Diet Tips for Weight Loss</h3>
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>1.	Consume Three Satisfying Meals Per Day</strong></h4>
                                <p>According to Ayurvedic tradition, the concepts of digestive fire, transformation, and digestion are inextricably intertwined. Maintaining a healthy metabolism necessitates the proper kindling of the digestive fire, which may be accomplished by providing the body with consistent and dependable fuel. To find an important balance, eat healthful, digestible meals every day without snacking between meals. This ensures that the digestive fire is appropriately activated and even stimulates it to become stronger.</p>
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>2.	Prepare a light dinner and eat it before 7 p.m.</strong></h4>
                                <p>Eating a small meal (preferably before 7 p.m.) helps your stomach to empty itself before going to sleep and promotes the natural detoxifying processes that take place overnight. Increase the amount of soups and salads in your meal to promote adequate system cleaning .</p>
                            
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>3.	Consume a Kapha-Pacifying Diet</strong></h4>
                                <p>Eating a kapha-calming diet helps to eliminate excess kapha from the system and may influence bodily transformation. The kapha diet should ideally consist of meals that are warm, dry, rough, light, and digestible. Instead of frozen, stale, or cold meals, choose freshly cooked homemade cuisine.</p>
                            
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>4.	Even when eating, practise awareness</strong></h4>
                                <p>By including meditation into your daily routine, you can lower your cortisol levels (a stress hormone linked to weight growth). Eating slowly and silently is another approach to enhance awareness. Pay attention to your body's cues regarding how much and when to eat.</p>
                            
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>5.	Workout at least three times every week.</strong></h4>
                                <p>Make time in your hectic schedule to exercise to guarantee a quicker metabolic rate and effective fat-burning. Walking, jogging, cycling, yoga, and swimming are all enjoyable physical activities. The greatest time to engage in physical activity is first thing in the morning, when your body has cleansed itself thoroughly and is ready for the day ahead.</p>
                            
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>6.	Consume more green vegetables</strong></h4>
                                <p>Consuming low-calorie green vegetables such as cabbage and karela is a popular home cure for weight loss (Bitter Gourd). Cabbage is said to be a good weight-loss therapy because it slows the conversion of sugar and other carbs into fat. Karela is a bitter type of drumstick that is used to beat the fat out of the body. Spices such as dried ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, and others may be used to liven up your food while also aiding in weight loss.</p>

                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>7.	Drink hot water or tea throughout the day.</strong></h4>
                                <p>In the Vedic tradition, hot water is known to be an elixir. Toxins, also known as ama, tend to build in the body as a result of external factors such as pollution, poor eating choices, and so on. Ama is reported to be sticky in nature and to dissolve quickly in hot water. First thing in the morning, take a few sips of warm water. To achieve the best results, add some fresh herbs, such as ginger.</p>
                                <p>Drinking 0.5 litres of water may raise your calorie expenditure by 24–30% over the next hour. Drinking water before meals may also result in lower calorie consumption, particularly among the middle-aged and elderly. Water is especially beneficial for weight loss when it is substituted for other beverages that are heavy in calories and sugar. </p>
                                <p>In general, rather than focusing just on weight loss, your first objective should be to fuel oneself with nutritious foods and important nutrients. A healthier lifestyle and the optimal weight levels will naturally follow.</p>
                                
                                
                                <h4 class="mt-2"><strong>8.	Get Plenty of Sleep</strong></h4>
                                <p>Sleep deprivation may have a negative impact on your health and weight. In fact, recent research investigations have discovered that a lack of sleep may be a component in weight increase. The best time period, according to Ayurveda, is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.</p>
                            
                                <p>
                                These suggestions may not benefit you in the near term, but they will in the long run. A healthy lifestyle is unquestionably the key to losing weight. However, make sure that you combine a balanced diet with some physical exercise.
                                </p>
                            <p>The Ayurvedic diet has been used by millions of people for thousands of years and is widely regarded as a technique of enhancing general health and wellness in many areas of the world. Ayurvedic diet aspects also coincide with nutrition basics used by Western medical and health professionals.</p>
                            <p>If weight loss is your objective, an Ayurvedic diet based on complete, unadulterated foods and mindful eating practises is likely to provide benefits. Always with your healthcare professional before making any large dietary changes or using herbal remedies to ensure that they do not interact with your existing prescriptions or the management of any medical issues.</p>

                            <p>Remember that following a long-term or short-term diet may not be essential for you, and many diets, especially long-term diets, simply do not work. While we do not support fad diets or unsustainable weight reduction approaches, we do give the facts so that you may make an informed decision that best suits your nutritional needs, genetic blueprint, budget, and objectives.</p>
                            <p>If you want to lose weight, keep in mind that reducing weight isn't always the same as being your healthiest self, and there are many other methods to achieve health. Exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle variables all have a significant impact on your overall health. The optimal diet is one that is well-balanced and matches your lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>Au- Revoir is the best resort in Palakkad for Ayurvedic Treatments. It provides the best ayurvedic treatment packages in Kerala. </p>
