                            <h3>Personalized Healing - Ayurveda </h3>
                            <p>Personalized healing by understanding one's body type, is focussed in Ayurveda.
Ayurveda holds a basic theory that all matter consists of 5 elements—air, ether (space), fire, water and earth. We humans, being matter, also have  these elements within us.

                            <p>The Doshas—Vata, Pitta and Kapha—according to Ayurveda are biological energies in our body and mind that correspond to these five elements. Vata comprises Ether and Air, Pitta of Fire and Water, and Kapha of Earth and Water. They exhibit all our characteristics, from the way we eat and digest to the way we sleep. Specific functions that affect your body, such as acne, bloating and even depression are governed by each dosha.
