                            <p>Only if we have peace of mind, can we enjoy all the good things in life. Accumulation of  material things, relations, name, and fame cannot essentially provide us with mental peace. </p>
                            <p>Body and mind are two different entities, but actually, they are the reflections of each other. The source of all physical problems is in the mind. </p>
                            <p>Stress is a major health concern now-a-days. It is the body's reaction to a certain situation - emotional or physically challenging, accompanied by the release of certain chemicals like adrenaline.</p>

                            <h3>Symptoms</h3>

                            <p>Stress differs from individual to individual. So its symptoms and causes also vary. Following are the common symptoms: </p>

                            <h4 class="color-g">Flushed and reddened face</h4>


                            <p>A small amount of stress is beneficial, in the sense that it increases productivity and gives a boost to your accomplishments.</p>

                            <h3>Causes</h3>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Highly competitive atmosphere</h4>

                            <h3>What are Stress and Strain according to Ayurveda?</h3>

                            <p>As per Ayurveda, the root of all problems-physical, mental, social, family, relationships, economic, and spiritual is stress on the body and mind. </p>

                            <p>Ayurveda states that stress is a state of mental/ emotional/physical strain and is called Manasa dosha. It is caused due to the imbalance of doshas. The Vata dosha is aggravated by improper diet, lack of exercise and improper routine. Excessive Vata affects the Mano vaha srota. The ability to reason decreases, which makes you less determined and results in low mental strength. The balance between the three doshas is responsible for the variation in the levels of strain.</p>

                            <p>On account of stress, the energy resources of the body get drained and your body is constantly pushed to a condition of strain.</p>

                            <p>Chronic stress and strain leads to the reduction of immunity and resistance power. It affects the normal physical and mental functioning of the body. Certain body mechanisms can break down. This gives rise to psychosomatic disorders such as:</p>

                            <h4 class="color-g">Hypertension</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Gastrointestinal Disorders</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Ischemic Heart Disease</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Diabetes mellitus</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Migraine</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Bronchial Asthma</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Arthritis</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Anxiety</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Depression</h4>
                            <h4 class="color-g">Insomnia</h4>

                            <p>Since every aspect of one's life gets disrupted due to stress and strain, it is very important to restore, regain, and retain the balance.</p>

                            <h3>Treatment of Stress and Strain in Ayurveda</h3>
