                            <p>Osteoarthritis, often called OA, is the most common type of arthritis that affects only the joints, usually in the hands, knees, hips, neck, and lower back. It happens due to the wearing down of the protective cartilage on the bones due to age or other factors. Its effect is set to grow as the prevalence of obesity increases and our elderly population rises.</p>
                            <p>Many doctors observe OA as being simply a disease of ‘wear and tear’, and by implication one in which disease transformation is not possible. Such preconceptions have led to a significant academic disregard for this disease that is indicated not only in our poor understanding of disease pathogenesis but also in the failure to categorize the disease with considerable precision and to develop sensitive tools for diagnosis and predictive assessment.</p>
                            <p>The recent identification of key degradative enzymes in cartilage and the use of various models to study disease pathogenesis have extensively changed our perspective. The next decade is likely to notice significant progress in our knowledge of, and treatment for, this condition.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h3>Signs of Osteoarthritis</h3>
                            <p>● Pain when you move, which frequently gets better with rest.</p>
                            <p>● Stiffness, especially for the first 30 minutes after you get up from relaxing</p>
                            <p>● Inflated joints, particularly after utilizing the joint a lot</p>
                            <p>● Less motion within the joint than usual</p>
                            <p>● A joint that feels unstable or loose</p>

                            <h3>Causes of Osteoarthritis</h3>
                            <p>Researchers are not sure of the reasons for osteoarthritis. It may be the result of a combination of elements inside the body and the environment. It is observed that the chances of developing osteoarthritis increase with age and some human beings are more likely to develop it than others.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurveda - Sandhigata Vata </h3>
                            <p>Ayurveda's goal of Osteoarthritis treatment is not only to control symptoms but also to prevent illness progression, minimize disability, enhance the quality of life, and also to set right the above-said causative components which lead to the formation of OA.</p>
                            <p>In Ayurveda, the symptoms similar to osteoarthritis are described under the header of Sandhigata Vata (degenerative arthritis). It happens due to vitiation of Vata dosha, which settles in the joint space causing swelling and pain in the joint. Due to this, there is a restriction on the movements of the joints.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda analyzes the causative elements like physiological, metabolic, excretory, and intellectual functions, lifestyle, food habits, and different elements which lead to the formation and development of OA.</p>

                            <h3>Matters that make you much more likely to develop osteoarthritis</h3>
                            <p>● Growing old. Osteoarthritis can happen at any age, but the chance of having it will increase in middle-aged adults and older. After age 50, it is more prevalent in women than in men.</p>
                            <p>● Being overweight. Excessive body weight puts extra pressure on your joints.</p>
                            <p>● Having past injury or surgery on a joint. This is usually the cause of osteoarthritis in younger adults.</p>
                            <p>● Doing a lot of activities that overuse the joint include sports with quite a few jumping, twisting, walking, or throwing.</p>
                            <p>● Having a joint that does not line up effectively</p>
                            <p>● A family history of osteoarthritis. Some people inherit congenital changes that increase their threat of growing osteoarthritis.</p>
                            <p>It is a prevailing perception that there is no permanent medication for osteoarthritis, but specific medications can provide pain relief. In addition to drugs, physical therapy and occupational therapy may also be proposed to improve joint functioning and strength.</p>
                            <p>For Osteoarthritis, Ayurveda has widespread treatments based on the severity and degrees of the disease from mild to severe. Ayurveda has numerous treatment methods for treating OA. Form of remedy and its duration depends merely on the severity of the sickness.</p>

                            <h3>Ayurveda Remedies to Deal with OA </h3>
                            <p>● Oleation therapy with medicated oils - Abhyanga</p>
                            <p>● Svedana Modalities </p>
                            <p>● Bashpasvedana - Therapy with evaporation </p>

                            <p>● Shastika Shali Pinda - Therapy with Herbal rice along with numerous medicinal herbs</p>
                            <p>● Upanaha Sveda - Therapy with the application of Herbal pastes</p>
                            <p>● Basti Therapies for each joint affected</p>
                            <p>● Janu Basti, Bahu Basti, Greeva Basti</p>
                            <p>● Lepa-application with numerous herbs and its extra to lower pain and its inflation.</p>
                            <p>● Rasayana therapies have remarkable biological outcomes, particularly as anti-inflation of memory and immune-modulatory actions that are relevant and potentially helpful to the treatment of OA.</p>
                            <p>Ayurveda Panchakarma treatments make surrounding tissue healthy. That is muscle tissues, ligaments, and tendons are responsible for joint stability. Recuperation of surrounding tissue of the joint facilitates the prevention or healing of Osteoarthritis. </p>

                            <h3>Perfect Place of Rejuvenation</h3>
                            <p>According to Ayurveda, ideal healing is the one that relieves the disease without resulting in any complications. Dealing with the symptoms of the disease may not always give relief to the patient from the disease. Consequently, Ayurveda believes in treating the fundamental factor of any illness to ensure long-enduring relief.</p>
