                            <h3>Skin issues</h3>

                            <h3>Stomach Bloating</h3>
                            <p>When toxins deposit in the body, bowel movements may become irregular which might result in constipation or stomach bloating as well as indigestion problems. All these signs are indicators that it is time for a body cleanse. Bowels need seasonal detox, particularly after the rich foods of winter.</p>
